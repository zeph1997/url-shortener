# url-shortener
A simple webpage I deployed on Heroku (currently inactive to conserve dyno hours) to shorten URL.

## Using The URL Shortener

Go to [zeph-urlshortener.herokuapp.com](https://zeph-urlshortener.herokuapp.com/).
![Landing Page](/Images/base_page.png)

Type in the url you want to shorten in the `Destination URL` field. Type in the custom URL pattern you want the shortened URL to have in the `Custom URL Pattern` field. Once you have filled in both fields, click `Shorten` to generate the shortened URL. This is what you should see.

Congratulations, you have just shortened your URL! ðŸŽ‰ 
(The URL looks long because I don't have a custom domain, but if you would like to donate to me so I can buy a custom domain, please feel free!)
## To Do
* Add in validation to check if the custom pattern exists in current database
